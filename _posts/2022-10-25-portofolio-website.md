## W﻿hy?

I﻿ wanted a place to showcase myself and the project I have worked on.

## A﻿bout

I﻿ have had three previous attempts at making my portfolio site. First I attempted to use Django, however that didn't work as Django was more than I need. In my second attempt, I used Bootstrap, and got much further, to a point I was almost happy with the result. However, that also had issues with updating the projects I had worked on. My third, and current attempt, led me to Jekyll and the Developr theme. This theme had what I was looking for, an easy-to-use site with the ability to update projects I have worked on.
